# Copilot Instructions for stock-predictor

## Project Overview
This repository is for a stock prediction project. The architecture, workflows, and conventions are minimal or not yet established, as the codebase is currently empty except for the `README.md` and license.

## Key Guidelines for AI Agents
- **Project Structure:**
  - No source code or subdirectories are present yet. Expect to create new files and directories as needed.
  - Place new source code in a `src/` directory unless otherwise specified.
- **Workflows:**
  - No build, test, or run scripts are defined. Recommend using standard Python project conventions unless directed otherwise.
  - If implementing ML or data workflows, document any new commands or scripts in the `README.md`.
- **Conventions:**
  - Follow PEP8 for Python code.
  - Use clear, descriptive names for files, functions, and classes.
  - Add docstrings to all public functions and classes.
- **External Dependencies:**
  - If adding dependencies, use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and update the `README.md` with install instructions.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the `README.md` with any new architecture, workflows, or usage instructions as the project evolves.

## Example Patterns
- Place main entry points in `src/main.py` or similar.
- Store data files in a `data/` directory.
- Add tests in a `tests/` directory, using `pytest` conventions.

## Next Steps
- If you add new components, document their purpose and usage in the `README.md` and update this file as needed.
- If you establish new conventions or workflows, describe them here for future agents.
